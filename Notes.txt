emitNotifications we have used in four scenarios 
1. follow button 
2. retweet button
3. like button 
4. submit reply button 


TODO
   
1. When a user delete's their post, all the replies to that post still exists in other user's profile as a post. 
    - Work-around: when deleting the post, remove all the post's comments as well. 
   
2. When someone tweets our post, we still have delete option to their tweeted posst, disable it. 
3. Rectify Notification - opened field 
    workarounds - css property - pretty cool 
      .resultsListItem.notification * {
       pointer-events: none;
    }
