 ------------------------------- Bugs observed ----------------------------------------
   
    1. When a user delete's their post, all the replies to that post still exists in other user's profile as a post. 
      - Work-around: when deleting the post, remove all the post's comments as well. 
   

    2. Profile page doesn't load posts until I pin any post, that is posts load function isn't working until I pin any post.
